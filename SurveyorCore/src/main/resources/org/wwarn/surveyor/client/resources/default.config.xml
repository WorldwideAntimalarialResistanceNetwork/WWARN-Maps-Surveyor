                product produced with criminal intent to mislead, without reference to intellectual
                property concerns. If authors did not examine packaging
                we class samples that failed chemical assays, but without detected
                wrong active ingredients, as poor quality and not falsified/counterfeit.
                Samples that did not fail chemical assays and/or a packaging tests are considered as good quality.
                Samples are only classified as 'Good Quality' if all samples collected were good quality.
                Samples classified as poor quality, falsified or substandard may contain good quality medicines.
